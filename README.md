<h1 align="center">SDB: High-accuracy stack profiler for Ruby</h1>

# Introduction
SDB provides high-accuracy stack profiling for Ruby applications. It can profile Ruby at **microsecond (0.000001 second)** intervals and offers event tagging for requests.

# Why Do We Need Another Stack Profiler?
1. Minimal Impact: SDB does not affect the target applicationâ€™s performance.
2. Event Tagging: SDB supports event tagging, making it easier to trace and identify slow functions.
3. High Accuracy: SDB offers precision down to microseconds.

Instrumentation libraries like `opentelemetry-ruby` generate data during application runtime, and some stack profilers block application threads. These approaches can introduce delays in your application.

SDB, inspired by [LDB](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi24/presentation/cho#:~:text=LDB%20observes%20the%20latency%20of,costs%20away%20from%20program%20threads.), operates by pulling stack traces on a separate thread, which minimizes the impact on our application.

Event tagging, such as adding trace_id for Puma requests, makes it easier to identify slow functions.

Moreover, SDB can precisely identify delays, down to a single microsecond.

# Usage Example
![roda](https://github.com/yfractal/sdb-analyzer/blob/main/images/roda.png)

The image above is generated by [sdb-analyzer](https://github.com/yfractal/sdb-analyzer). It represents a simple Ruby API application rendering an empty body.

The image clearly shows which methods are used and their latency, helping us understand the application's behavior and identify potential latency issues, even without prior background knowledge.

# NOTICE
SDB is still in **the experimental stage**. Rather than focusing on ease of use and stability, I am exploring additional use cases, such as detecting concurrency issues or delays caused by GVL.
